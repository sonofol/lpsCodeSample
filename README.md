# lpsCodeSample
Description: a small project consisting of the following javascript files:
- IntegerResult.js: a class to hold integer results
- myFunctions.js: an IIFE containing helper functions
- script.js: page event handling
- numberExt.js: file containing Number prototype extensions for determining integers, odd integers, even integers, and prime integers
- index.html: web page to demonstrate project functionality

# Demo instructions
1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Type lines of text into the top text area, each followed by Return/Enter. Ensure some lines of text are stand-alone integers.
3. Click the buttons to test the various functions.

This simple project demonstrates OOD principles through the use of prototype inheritance (numberExt.js), the use of Revealing Module design pattern (IntegerResult.js, myFunctions.js), and the use of dependency-injected function references.
